## DHT11, KY-018 and Grow Lights Subsystem

### Software Technologies
- ThingsBoard Integration for real-time sensor data visualization and remote control.
- SMTP for email alerts based on sensor thresholds (e.g., light levels or temperature).
- OTA (Over-the-Air) updates for seamless firmware upgrades without physical access.

### Hardware
- ESP8266 microcontroller for lightweight IoT control and Wi-Fi communication.
- DHT11 for measuring temperature and humidity.
- KY-018 photoresistor sensor for detecting ambient light levels.
- Relay module to switch the grow lights ON/OFF.
- Grow Lights to provide artificial light for plant growth.

## Water Level Sensor & Water Pump Relay Subsystem

### Software Technologies
- ThingsBoard Integration to monitor water levels and trigger pump activation.
- Sleep Modes (Modem, Light, Deep) for power efficiency during idle periods.
- OTA (Over-the-Air) updates for remote firmware management.

### Hardware
- ESP32-S3 microcontroller for enhanced processing and low-power capabilities.
- Water Level Sensor to detect the presence or absence of water in the reservoir.
- Relay module to control the water pump.
- Water Pump to circulate or deliver water as needed.
